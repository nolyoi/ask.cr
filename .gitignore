About Askcr
I'm currently building a Q/A platform for the Crystal language which is pretty new and unknown. Hoping to spread it and be a good resource to ask and find answers to questions. Right now, all of the costs will be out of my pocket.

Also, the code is open-source. Written in Crystal which is also open-source, and with the Lucky Framework (you guessed it, also open-sourcE), both of which I'm trying to help grow.

I think a dedicated Q/A like StackOverflow would be a good place to start. Except this Q/A is focused specficially on the Crystal ecosystem (Crystal, shards, frameworks, guis, etc.)

Users will be able to ask, answer, mark solutions to their questions, earn achievements, tip each other via various crypto methods and more top secret features coming soon! I do have a decent amount of interest in this project so including LW46cVQKT4b5SpgBaxBAD9Pb78UFHGnY83V3jgvHT8Tc9Xscr61vuAHZdaMQqLJjof2KC5Zx6NoU5Nw5pqrS1ALs5otQ1mr as a tipping option could help benefit us both!

The project is currently being re-written and the initial release is about 80% done for it's initial release! You can play with the testing version and very buggy version of the app here for now: https://askcrio.herokuapp.com/

If you'd like to help, please feel free to open up issues or contribute code. As of now I'm doing this all on my own.

So, I was wondering if the crypto community could help out.
for oversince launch because they have such an amazing team and their Proof of Stake seems very fair,

Launch should be in the next 1-2 weeks! You can plat with a very buggy test version here before launch: http://askcr.io (the info posted during alpha may or may not be reset before official launch

Sad to see no Oxen donors as it is legitimately 100% my favorite project on the market now. ðŸ˜Œ
