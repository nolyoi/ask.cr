# Askcr.io

This is a project written using [Lucky](https://luckyframework.org) and is inspired by StackOverflow. This project was made to serve as a resource for the Crystal programming language where users can get help by asking questions and help others by sharing their knowledge and answering questions.

Users will be able to ask, answer, mark solutions to their questions, earn achievements, tip each other via various crypto methods and more top secret feaures coming soon!

The project is currently being re-written and the initial release is abouot 80% done for it's initial release! You can play with the testing version and very buggy version of the app here for now: https://askcrio.herokuapp.com/
