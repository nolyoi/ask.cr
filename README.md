# Askcr.io

This is a project written using [Lucky](https://luckyframework.org) and is inspired by StackOverflow. This project was made to serve as a resource for the Crystal programming language where users can get help by asking questions and help others by sharing their knowledge and answering questions.

Users will be able to ask, answer, mark solutions to their questions, earn achievements, tip each other via various crypto methods and more top secret feaures coming soon!

The project is currently being re-written and the initial release is abouot 80% done for it's initial release! You can play with the testing version here: https://askcrio.herokuapp.com/

If you'd like to help, please feel free to open up issues or contribute code. As of now I'm doing this all on my own. 

If you would like to donate to the project and help pay the server and domain bills, you can donate the following ways. I have built this myself and will be paying for it out of my own pocket.

Also, whichever coin raises the most before launch will have a nice advertisement featured across the site forever!
